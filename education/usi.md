During my academic journey, I had the honor of attending Universit√† della Svizzera Italiana (USI) in Lugano as part of my Master of Science in Computer Science program at the University of Milan-Bicocca (unimib). Winning the double degree scholarship enabled me to spend the second year of my master's program immersed in USI's vibrant academic environment, significantly enriching my educational and personal growth.

### üìö Academic Excellence
At USI, I maintained an exceptional GPA of 9.9, reflecting my dedication and passion for my studies. I completed advanced courses that enhanced my technical skills:

- **Advanced Java Programming**: Focused on object-oriented, functional, and concurrent programming for extensible and scalable software systems. Covered advanced profiling and program-analysis techniques for optimizing performance in Java.
- **S&DE Atelier: Visual Analytics**: Provided practical experience in data cleaning, analysis, and visualization using Jupyter, Pandas, and Bokeh, including handling geo-spatial data and creating interactive dashboards with ElasticSearch and Kibana.
- **Software Performance**: Explored how different layers of a computer system interact and affect performance, covering memory usage, garbage collection, virtual memory, cache performance, dynamic class loading, and compiler optimizations.
- **Software Design & Modeling**: Emphasized creating robust software designs using various modeling techniques essential for developing scalable and maintainable software systems.
- **Software Quality & Testing**: Specialized in software testing methodologies and quality assurance processes crucial for delivering high-quality software products.


### üìù Thesis Project: SYN
While at USI, I undertook one of the most challenging projects of my academic career: my thesis, titled [SYN](/project/syn). This rigorous endeavor tested my limits and pushed me to apply all the skills and knowledge I had acquired, demanding perseverance, innovative thinking, and meticulous attention to detail.

### üèÜ Summa Cum Laude Achievement
My time at USI culminated in earning a degree summa cum laude, a testament to my hard work and commitment to academic excellence. The rigorous curriculum and stimulating academic environment at USI played a pivotal role in shaping my technical skills and problem-solving abilities, preparing me for the challenges of the professional world.
