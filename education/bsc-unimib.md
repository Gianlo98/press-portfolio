### üéì Bachelor of Science in Computer Science

With a passion for innovation and a drive for excellence, I embarked on my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at the University of Milan-Bicocca. My academic journey was marked by a **GPA of 29/30** and a final grade of **110/110 summa cum laude**, demonstrating my commitment to mastering the complexities of computer science. Below are some of the key courses that shaped my expertise and fueled my enthusiasm for the field:

### üìö Key Courses

- **Algorithms and Data Structures**: This foundational course covered essential algorithms and data structures, providing a deep understanding of algorithmic design and analysis. 
- **Computer Architecture**: Focused on the principles of computer organization, including hardware components, instruction sets (MIPS), and system architecture, which deepened my understanding of the hardware-software interface.
- **Database Systems**: Explored the fundamentals of database design, implementation, and management, with an emphasis on SQL and data modeling techniques.
- **Distributed Systems**: Covered the principles and design of distributed systems, emphasizing scalability, fault tolerance, and consistency, which are critical for modern cloud computing environments.
- **Probability and Statistics for Computer Science**: Provided the statistical foundations and probabilistic models essential for machine learning, focusing on data analysis and predictive modeling.
- **Software Engineering**: Emphasized software development methodologies, project management, and quality assurance practices, ensuring high standards in software delivery.
- **Algorithm Analysis and Design**: An advanced study of algorithmic strategies and complexity, crucial for developing efficient and effective computational solutions.
- **Linear Algebra and Geometry**: Provided a deep understanding of vector spaces, linear transformations, and geometric structures, fundamental to various computer science applications.

### üìù Thesis: Automatic Computation of Architectural Smells Cost Solving

For my thesis, I focused on **Automatic Computation of Architectural Smells Cost Solving**, specifically addressing the Hub Like Dependency smell. Architectural Smells indicate poor design choices that negatively impact software quality and contribute to Technical Debt. My approach involved developing a technique for Java projects to automatically evaluate the cost of solving this smell.

I validated my approach using Open Source Java systems, manually refactoring instances of Hub Like Dependency to gather empirical data. Additionally, I utilized [Arcan](/project/arcan), a software analysis tool, to automate the detection of this smell. My work included developing a formula to estimate the cost of removing the smell and exploring the potential of using linear regression to predict this cost.


I successfully defended my thesis at unimib in October 2022, earning the **summa cum laude** distinction. This academic journey has equipped me with a solid technical foundation and prepared me to tackle complex problems and innovate in various environments üî•üí™.
