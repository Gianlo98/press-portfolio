My high school diploma, taken in the beautiful city of [Ragusa](https://www.italia.it/en/sicily/ragusa) (Sicily), specialized in Business Information Systems, where I gained in-depth technical and IT knowledge. This included a blend of IT and economic studies such as business economics, political economy, and more.

### üìù Final Project: Bilancio EA

For my high school dissertation project, I developed [**Bilancio EA**](/project/bilancio-ea), an application using PHP and MariaDB to automate the generation of income statements and balance sheets. This project addressed the repetitive task of manually creating these financial statements from our "Business Economics" book exercises. BilancioEA assists students with pre-made exercises, simplifies sharing through QR codes or direct links, and allows teachers to create new exercises by entering account details. It supports the generation of various financial statements, including income statements, balance sheets, reclassified statements, and ratio analysis for profitability, asset structure, and financial structure.

### Outcome üèÜ

The project saved time and ensured accuracy in financial statement generation. **I was awarded the highest grade for my efforts**. This project demonstrated my ability to apply theoretical knowledge to practical problems and showcased my initiative and project management skills. My final exam grades were among the highest, reflecting my keen interest in business economics. Five years of education in economics and IT set the foundation for my current skills and interests.
