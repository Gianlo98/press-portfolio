During my Master's program at the University of Milan-Bicocca (unimib), I immersed myself in a rigorous and dynamic curriculum that significantly enhanced my skills in AI, cloud computing, and algorithms. With a **perfect GPA of 30/30**, achieved without failing a single exam, I demonstrated my dedication and passion for my studies 💪😎. This exceptional academic performance earned me the opportunity to study at USI on a double degree scholarship.

### 📚 Key Courses
- **Machine Learning**: This course was a cornerstone of my studies, equipping me with practical skills in building and deploying machine learning models. I delved into various algorithms and techniques, gaining hands-on experience that fueled my enthusiasm for AI.
- **Data Analytics**: I developed a deep understanding of extracting meaningful insights from large datasets, a skill crucial for data-driven decision-making. The course's focus on practical applications and modern tools sparked my passion for turning raw data into actionable knowledge. 
- **Software Process and Development**: Here, I learned about software development methodologies, project management, and quality assurance practices. This course highlighted the importance of structured processes in delivering high-quality software, reinforcing my commitment to excellence in every project. 
- **Architectures of Data**: This course provided profound insights into designing and managing scalable data architectures. I was fascinated by the intricacies of data storage and retrieval systems, and I developed a keen interest in optimizing performance and scalability. 
- **Probabilistic Models for Decisions**: I explored representing uncertainty in decision problems, mastering Bayesian Networks, Markov Chains 🫶, and probabilistic reasoning. This course sharpened my analytical skills and deepened my appreciation for the complexity of real-world decision-making. 

### 🏆 Summa Cum Laude Achievement
The challenging experience at unimib not only improved my technical skills but also fueled my enthusiasm and passion for computer science. Every course, project, and interaction was an opportunity to grow and learn. I successfully defended my thesis [SYN](/project/syn) in July 2022, which gave me the honor of earning the **laude** distinction. This academic journey, combined with my experience at USI, has equipped me with a global perspective and a robust technical foundation.
