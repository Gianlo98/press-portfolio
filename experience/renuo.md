# Renuo AG

At Renuo AG, I've been diving headfirst into the dynamic tech stack of Renovero, a Swisscom project that harnesses the power of AWS. As an innovative force within the team, I've been actively enhancing the product by developing and deploying cutting-edge features while streamlining the existing codebase for optimal performance. My experience at Renuo AG has been an exhilarating journey through cloud technologies, challenging me to grow and evolve as a developer in today's ever-changing digital landscape.
