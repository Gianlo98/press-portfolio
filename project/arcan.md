### 🚀 Joining the Team
After impressing a PhD during a Software Engineering course with my [SmartHome project](/project/smarthome), I was invited to join Arcan to help launch their startup. I was the youngest member, working alongside a team of brilliant PhDs, to create a tool that analyzes and improves system architectural quality.

### 🛠️ My Role
I was fully responsible for the UI, choosing React and Material UI for the project. My task was to transform a CLI-only tool into a user-friendly interface with graphs, tables, and charts, making complex data easy to understand and interpret.

### 🤝 Collaboration and Challenges
We worked in a team of four, following an agile approach with weekly sprints. We faced several UI challenges, particularly in data visualization, ensuring that numbers were easy to understand and charts were intuitive. It was a demanding task, but incredibly rewarding.

### 🌟 Impact and Achievements
The new UI significantly expanded the tool's capabilities, aiding in its acceptance into a Start-up Acceleration program. The project, now successful in an AI incubator, stands as a testament to our hard work and collaboration. Seeing the progress made over two years and knowing my contributions helped pave the way for their current success is immensely satisfying.

I won't easily forget this experience: fun, hard, and rewarding all at once! What a fantastic combo! 😆 

I'll always be cheering for them as they continue to innovate and grow ❤️.... Curious to see what they're up to? Check them out on their [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/company/arcan).
