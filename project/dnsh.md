### 🚀 Project Overview
I was asked by a company to develop a platform to manage the complex certification process for other companies to be compliant with DNSH (Do Not Significantly Harm) guidelines. To accomplish this, I built and led a team of engineers, leveraging my extensive knowledge from previous work and projects. 

### Platform Features 🚀

The tool manages the various phases required to certify a company, supporting operators throughout the process. It aims to autonomously reduce error rates and boost productivity, with the help of AI.

### Technical Implementation 🛠️

From a technical standpoint, I configured a continuous deployment environment where code committed to the main branch is automatically deployed in a production environment on a serverless GCP instance. We utilized Java and React for development and Postgres for the database.

### Leadership and Collaboration 👥

I led the team by setting the direction and choosing the frameworks. We followed the development from the conceptual phase through to actual development, ensuring clear communication and collaboration within the team.

### Current Status and Future Impact 📈

Although the project is still in its initial phase, we are optimistic about its potential impact. Our collaborative efforts are focused on creating an efficient, error-reducing platform that enhances the certification process.
