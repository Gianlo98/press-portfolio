### Project Overview 

I had the opportunity to collaborate with a company that won the public bid to develop the official app for the municipality of Ragusa, my hometown. This project was a significant step in my career as it involved creating a native app distributed on both the Apple and Google stores ðŸ“±.

### Role and Responsibilities ðŸ’»

The company utilized an enterprise subscription with Goodbarber, a CMS designed for app development. My primary responsibility was to implement the responsive design for the homepage using plain HTML and CSS, as the company provided the design specifications. Although I was used to work with Bootstrap to easily style webpages, this project required me to build everything from scratch âœ¨.

### Challenges and Innovations ðŸš€

We aimed to automatically publish news from the official municipality of Ragusa's website onto the app. However, there was no existing integration between the two systems. I saw this as a challenge and an opportunity for innovation. I developed a PHP RSS feed to bridge the gap between the systems, successfully linking them ðŸ”—. This solution enhanced the app's capabilities by ensuring that news updates were automatically published, keeping the app's content fresh and relevant ðŸ“°.

### Learning and Growth ðŸ’ª

This experience was incredibly enriching, as it allowed me to deepen my understanding of CSS commands, improve my skills in responsive web design, and tackle a complex integration problem. Despite the challenges of stepping out of my comfort zone, I successfully delivered a fully functional and aesthetically pleasing homepage that adhered to the design specifications and provided a seamless user experience ðŸŽ‰.
