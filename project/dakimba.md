### My Role at Dakimba üåü

At Dakimba, I played a crucial role in transforming the vision of a revolutionary travel platform into reality. Although the startup was ultimately never launched, my contributions had a lasting impact, including a patented innovation recognized in the industry.

### Building the First Prototype üõ†Ô∏è

One of my most challenging yet rewarding tasks was building the first prototype for the Fast Check-in system. This was a super hard, one-week job carried out during my summer break. The intensive work paid off, and the prototype was 100% functional by the end. The satisfaction of seeing my efforts result in a working system was immense and fueled further development.

We first focused on developing a prototype for a Fast Check-in system, designed to streamline the check-in process for travelers. This system aimed to reduce waiting times and improve user experience by allowing guests to check in directly via an automated process. This innovative solution was well-received and formed the basis for further development.

### Booking Management Website üåê

Building on the success of the Fast Check-in prototype, I then led the development of a comprehensive website to manage bookings. This platform facilitated direct communication between travelers and accommodation providers, eliminating intermediaries and their associated costs. The website was designed to be user-friendly, ensuring a smooth and efficient booking process that benefited both customers and hosts.

### Innovation and Patented Idea üí°

One of my significant contributions was the proposal and development of a novel idea to enhance the platform‚Äôs technology.
