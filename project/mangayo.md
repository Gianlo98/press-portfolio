## Project Overview 📈

I was initially approached by MangaYo! to create an e-commerce website to kickstart their business. Using Prestashop as a CMS, I developed the project from scratch, implementing various domain-specific features. The project spanned from October 2022 to the present, and since its release, the platform has handled over 200,000 orders.

## Leadership and Strategic Influence 🏆

Recognizing the quality and efficiency of my work, MangaYo! made me a partner, granting me a significant role in the company's strategic decisions beyond IT. As a technical leader, I have to make business-critical IT decisions, coordinate teams, and manage personnel to ensure the platform's success 🚀. I feel the responsibility of the company's success on my shoulders, driving me to make impactful decisions and innovations. I'm also immensely grateful to the amazing team I work with, whose dedication and talent make our achievements possible.

## Key Responsibilities and Achievements 🌟

### IT Infrastructure Management 🖥️

As the IT lead, I ensure the stability and scalability of the platform. During peak customer traffic, especially during live streams with major influencers, I engineered and implemented a custom queue system. This innovation prevented site crashes and maintained a smooth user experience, even under heavy loads.

### Operational Efficiency 🚀

To streamline operations, I developed a custom web app to optimize warehouse order processing speed. This resulted in a 5x improvement, significantly reducing delivery times and enhancing scalability. Additionally, I created several scripts to automate administrative operations, such as tax declarations and order discovery, resulting in a 10x improvement in time-consuming activities.

### SEO and Market Impact 🌐

I conducted initial SEO optimization, which led to MangaYo! ranking 1st on almost all relevant keywords and top 5 for each product. This was crucial for the e-commerce's success, contributing to a revenue of 4M in 2022 ([source](https://www.ufficiocamerale.it/1199/mangayo-societa-a-responsabilita-limitata-semplificata)). This SEO success has been instrumental in driving organic traffic and establishing MangaYo! as a market leader.

### Mobile App Development and Success 📱✨

I supported the development and integration of MangaYo!’s native app, which became an incredible success, ranking 5th in the App Store. The app has significantly boosted website leads, generated sales, and increased customer loyalty. This mobile app has been a game-changer for MangaYo!, enhancing user engagement and driving sales.

### Scalability Solutions ⚙️

To address scalability issues, I temporarily implemented a queue system and leveraged AWS. These measures ensured the website remained operational during high-traffic periods, allowing MangaYo! to handle approximately 15,000 users simultaneously without crashing. This solution provided the necessary time to adapt and scale services for the domestic market without taking the website offline.

## Conclusion and Impact 💼
Overall, my involvement in MangaYo! has led to its substantial growth and operational success, establishing it as a leading e-commerce platform in Italy. The combination of strategic decision-making, technical leadership, and a collaborative team effort has driven the platform to new heights, ensuring continued growth and market leadership. As a new partner, I am excited about the future and eager to contribute further to MangaYo!'s ongoing success.
