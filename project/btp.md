In a team of two software engineers, we developed **Investire In BTP**, a free tool designed to provide detailed information, analysis, and real-time updates on Italian government bonds (BTPs). Our platform targets a niche of around 500,000 users interested in bond investments, offering unique tools and insights.

### üîç Key Features

Investire In BTP provides real-time updates and detailed yield calculations, allowing investors to stay informed with the latest data on BTPs. The platform features a user-friendly interface designed to engage and retain users, coupled with SEO-optimized content to enhance search engine visibility. Key features include:

- **Bond Details with Two Views**: Users can view bond details in either a table or card format.
- **Yield Calculator**: Calculate the net yield of a bond easily.
- **Minusvalenze Calculator**: Compute compensable capital losses.
- **Portfolio Simulator**: Simulate your bond portfolio for better investment decisions.
- **News/Course Section**: Stay updated with the latest developments and insights on Italian government bonds.
- **Newsletter Service**: Receive timely insights and information directly to your inbox.

### üõ†Ô∏è Development Highlights

In the backend, we implemented data acquisition and storage solutions using Supabase, ensuring reliable and timely market data integration. On the frontend, we developed an intuitive and visually appealing interface that enhances user experience and engagement. The tools for managing bond yields, capital losses, and portfolio simulations automate tasks that were traditionally done in Excel.

Adopting a headless CMS was a significant step, allowing team members without development skills to manage news and content efficiently. This integration streamlined operations and ensured that our platform remains updated with relevant information.

### Personal Insights üåü

The project was a lot of fun and a great learning experience from conceptual to practical aspects. We are proud of the synergy within our team and the impressive outcome of our efforts. Our enthusiasm for this project shines through in the quality and functionality of the platform. We aim to become the leading platform for Italian government bond investors, providing comprehensive and reliable tools for investment analysis.
