## Project Overview üì∫

Following the enthusiasm from my previous [IoT project](/project/smart-light), I embarked on a hobby project to integrate my Sony Bravia TV with Apple HomeKit, enabling me to control it with my voice and Apple devices.

## Challenge and Solution üõ†Ô∏è

To achieve this, I reverse-engineered the API calls made by the Sony Bravia app. Using a proxy installed on my phone, I monitored the local network calls and captured the authorization headers sent to my TV. Once I successfully replicated the API calls, I studied the HomeKit Accessory Protocol (HAP) and implemented it to build a custom app.

One of the significant challenges was accurately capturing and replicating the API calls necessary for communication between the TV and HomeKit. Overcoming this hurdle involved meticulous monitoring and testing. Afterward, the implementation of the HAP protocol was straightforward, thanks to thorough documentation and community support.

## Impact and Results üåü

The result was satisfying: I could turn my TV on and off using Siri on my iPhone or my Apple Watch, making it a convenient solution, especially when the remote control was lost üòÜ.
